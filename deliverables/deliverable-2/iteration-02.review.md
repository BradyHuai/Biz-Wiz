# Biz-Wiz/Raptors

## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: November 20th
 * Where: Online via Zoom meeting
## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

 * Decision1: We have decided to have weekly sync up with our partner every Tuesday. We choose to have this weekly meeting, because it makes sure that our information is updated regularly and the partner’s requests are fulfilled and discussed. The first half of the meeting is our team members demonstrating our process, and the second half is our partner giving feedback while making new demands. This decision turned out to be successful because it not only gives the team members a great view on what the client wants, and what we should be implementing, it also helps our partner to examine the current process and update their demand if that is not what they wanted initially.
 * Decision2: We have decided to split the group into two parts, where one group is responsible for the front end while the other is implementing the backend and database. This turns out to be successful in some parts. Since, the timetables are very different across our team, we are having a hard time scheduling meetings with all group members. Splitting the group into two parts can reduce the possibility of conflict schedules, since front end developers can schedule smaller group meetings and same as back end. 

#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * Decision1: We have decided to split the group into front end developers and back end developers. However it requires us to spend time joining the two parts together, and exchanging data is a headache. What we could have done better is to have one person as a project leader, or full stack developer, who keeps track of the progress on both ends, and make sure that the data are consistent. 
 * Decision2: We have decided to connect front end and back end after both ends are fully implemented. This decision is unsuccessful, because it requires a huge amount of code integration and refactoring. For deliverable 3, we would have weekly sync up between frontend and backend to get the most updated client server call.
 * Decision3: One of the decisions that were unsuccessful was weekly group meetings separate from the partner meeting. This is not necessarily a bad decision, but it was unsuccesful because we were not able to fulfill this decision. Many of us had different schedules are could not meet that often resulting in work taking longer since we all worked individually.  



#### Q3. Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)
* We plan to hold more group meetings. In the past month, the number of group meetings weren't as many as we had initially planned for which made work unorganized as we could not sync up our progress. Even with an agreed date and time to have weekly meetings, unfortunately many group members are very busy with their schedules. The changes we plan to make are to be more firm on the dates we plan meetings on and to make sure that everyone is free during that time. We are making this change to make the work process smoother and ensure that the project will be functional.
 * We also plan to have more pair programming sections(group programming), we realized that pair programming can increase the efficiency of our work, and it also increases synchronization between work done by each individual. Thus, it reduces the time needed to understand each other’s code. We are making this change because the work we have done for deliverable 2 was difficult when we were all working individually.


## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 * We prepared the demo on our local computers. Before each meeting, we make sure the client web pages can be deployed on local hosts through npm start. Then, the features and pages can be operated.
 * The frontend and backend was demonstrated to the partner through a zoom call. We showed some features such as the map, posting job requests, as well as the administrator backend which can be used to modify data. We shared our screen and ran the demos.
 * Since our partner provided a list of requirements and demands, the client implementation is developed based on the list. Thus our partner accepted most of the features. Main features include search job postings via google map page, post job postings, and business and individual account login sign up.
 * There were changes made by our partner: 1. get rid of the “volunteer” option under the drop-down menu on the map. 2. create an email confirmation for Biz-Wiz team when an account has been registered and also wanting visual changes of the ui.
 * During demonstrations, sometimes we used technical terms and showed some source code which our partner does not understand. We learned that during demos to clients, it is better to use conversational language rather than technical language. Product wise, we learned the partner’s feedback can be very detailed, for instance the placement of a button or spelling of a word.
 * Overall, the demos were presented well and the partner was pleased with what they were seeing.
